## What does this app do?
Bluetooth Smart Saver is an automatic power saving utility, for people who participate in a lot of audio calls using Bluetooth Headsets. Mininum supported `Android` version is `5.0 Lollipop`. This app runs a service, separately in the background from the graphical user interface of the app.
The purpose of this service is to enable Bluetooth, when you receive an incoming call or when you make an outgoing call, and to disable Bluetooth once the call is over. 
Even if you close the app (or remove it from "Recent apps") this service will still work in the background. The service can be stopped or started anytime either in-app or by the notification bar.
