        Bluetooth Smart Saver is an automatic power saving utility,
        for people who participate in a lot of audio calls using
        Bluetooth Headsets.\n
        This app runs a service, separately in the background from the graphical UI of the app.
        The purpose of this service is to enable bluetooth, when you receive an incoming call
        or when you make an outgoing call, and to disable bluetooth once the call is over.
        Even if you close the app (or remove it from \'Recent apps\') this service
        will still work in the background. You can see if the service is running
        by looking at your notification bar.\n
        To <b>enable this service</b>, slide the Smart Switch on
        the right, whereas to <b>disable this service</b> slide it on
        the left. When you enable or disable the service, a message will
        be displayed on the bottom of your screen, indicating whether
        the service is started or stopped.\n
        By default, the service is stopped.
        The app remembers if the service is started or stopped,
        even if you close the app, and re-open it later.
        This enables you to stop the service at anytime.\n\n
