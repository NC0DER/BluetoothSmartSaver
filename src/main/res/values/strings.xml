        Bluetooth Smart Saver is an automatic power saving utility,
        for people who participate in a lot of audio calls using
        Bluetooth Headsets.\n
        This app runs a foreground service, which is a process,
        that runs separately in the background from the graphical UI
        of the app. The purpose of this service is to enable bluetooth
        when you receive an incoming call or when you make an outgoing call,
        and to disable bluetooth once the call is over. Even if you close
        the app (or remove it from \'Recent apps\') this service will
        still work in the background.\n

        To <b>enable this process</b>, slide the Smart Switch on
        the right, whereas to <b>disable this process</b> slide it on
        the left. When you enable or disable the process, a message will
        be displayed on the bottom of your screen, indicating whether
        the process is started or stopped.\n

        By default, the process is stopped.
        The app remembers if the process is started or stopped,
        even if you close the app, and re-open it later.
        This enables you to stop the service at anytime.\n\n
